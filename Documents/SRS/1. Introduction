1.	Introduction (5 pts)
1.1	Problem statement
  Homeless shelters offer beds to sleep on during the night; however, there are times when the beds for these shelters are filled up,
  leaving homeless people with no place to sleep. They must travel to various other homeless shelters in search for vacant beds that they
  can occupy.  Homeless people often lack transportation, so it can take them several minutes or a few hours of walking until they reach
  their destination. Their journey continues until they discover a shelter that can take them in.

  Homeless people frequently cannot access enough information about the homeless shelters regarding the number of beds available. 
  They resort to taking a more tactical approach by visiting every homeless shelter they can, in hopes that they can find a bed.

1.2	Proposed solution
  We propose a strategic approach for homeless people in search of a bed. That is, a website that will display information about homeless shelters. 

  The website will have details about various shelters, such as: description, location, phone number, and number of beds available.
  Shelter organizations will periodically update the number of beds available, which will be inputted in the database and displayed
  onto the website. Shelter organization’s entries onto our system may be added.

  The website will inform the user of nearby shelters. This is accomplished by the website to conduct a search when given the address,
  zip code, and/or their current location. A map service will pop-up on the website, displaying nearby homeless shelters relative to the
  given location. There, customers may click on shelters to view their information. The map service will also provide directions if requested.

  Our service will grant homeless people the information they need to determine which shelter to visit next.

1.3	Novelty
Our proposed solution will have these following set of features so that it may be a successful resource in combating the problem statement.
  1.	Website registration
  2.	Notify users if their credentials are incorrect
  3.	Database that stores shelter organization’s background information
  4.	Website that reflects database information
  5.	Picture preview of the shelter
  6.	Time when the information was updated
  7.	System periodically updates the website information based on the database
  8.	Allows customers to know how many beds are available at each shelter
  9.	Multiple types of accounts, which are customer account, shelter staff account, and admin account
  10.	Allows registered accounts to store favorite shelters for quick access
  11.	Allows shelter staff to change their available bed count
  12.	Find shelters near a given location
  13.	Supports customers who use current location services
  14.	Give directions from one address to another

1.	Centralized information: Our website will display information gathered from various shelters.
      This will be a valuable resource for those seeking shelter. Instead of searching through multiple shelter 
      organization websites for specific information, they can initially enter our website and be complete with their research.
    
2.	Dynamic updates: Our system will periodically update what is being displayed on the website based on the information stored
    inside the database. This maintains our displayed information to be relevant and accurate.
